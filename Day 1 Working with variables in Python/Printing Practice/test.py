# Printing Practice
# Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output 
# console. The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code. 
# Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below. 
# Make sure that you don't change any of these existing text as everything, punctuation 
# and casing all need to match!
